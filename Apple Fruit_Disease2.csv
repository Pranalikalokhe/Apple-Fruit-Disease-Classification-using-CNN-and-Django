1,Apple : Scab,"Apple scab is the most common disease of apple and crabapple trees in Minnesota.
Scab is caused by a fungus that infects both leaves and fruit.
Scabby fruit are often unfit for eating.
Infected leaves have olive green to brown spots.
Leaves with many leaf spots turn yellow and fall off early.
Leaf loss weakens the tree when it occurs many years in a row.
Planting disease resistant varieties is the best way to manage scab.","Choose resistant varieties when possible.
Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.
Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.
Spread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.
For best control, spray liquid copper soap early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop.",https://extension.umn.edu/sites/extension.umn.edu/files/apple-scab-1.jpg
2,Apple : Black Rot,"Leaf symptoms first occur early in the spring when the leaves are unfolding.
They appear as small, purple specks on the upper surface of the leaves that enlarge into circular lesions 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3-6 mm) in diameter.
The margin of the lesions remains purple, while the center turns tan to brown. In a few weeks, secondary enlargement of these leaf spots occurs.
Heavily infected leaves become chlorotic and defoliation occurs.
As the rotted area enlarges, a series of concentric bands of uniform width form which alternate in color from black to brown. The flesh of the rotted area remains firm and leathery. Black pycnidia are often seen on the surface of the infected fruit.","Remove the cankers by pruning at least 15 inches below the end and burn or bury them. Also take preventative care with new season prunings and burn them, too.You are better off pruning during the dormant season. This will minimize the odds that fire blight will infect your tree and produce dead tissue that can easily be infected by Botryosphaeria.You should also take precautions if the bark is damaged by hail, or branches break during a windstorm. Using a copper-based fungicide will protect against both black rot and fire blight.",http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/blackrotf1.jpg
3,Apple : Cedar rust,"Cedar apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) is a fungal disease that requires juniper plants to complete its complicated two year life-cycle. Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.","Choose resistant cultivars when available.
Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.
Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.
Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.
On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.
Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.",https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/apple-rust.jpg
4,Apple : Healthy,"As with most fruit, apples produce best when grown in full sun, which means six or more hours of direct summer Sun daily.The best exposure for apples is a north side of a house, tree line, or rise rather than the south.Apple trees need well-drained soil, but should be able to retain some moisture.","Apples Are Nutritious. 
Apples May Be Good for Weight Loss.
Apples May Be Good for Your Heart. 
They're Linked to a Lower Risk of Diabetes. 
They May Have Prebiotic Effects and Promote Good Gut Bacteria.
Substances in Apples May Help Prevent Cancer.",https://previews.123rf.com/images/msnobody/msnobody1508/msnobody150800002/43698436-red-apple-on-a-branch-of-an-apple-tree-on-a-sunny-day-organic-farmingagriculture-fresh-healthy-natur.jpg
5,Apple : Scab,"Gray leaf spot on corn, caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis, is a peren- nial and economically damaging disease in the United States. Since the mid-1990s, the disease has increased in importance in Indiana, and now is the one of the most important foliar diseases of corn in the state.Gray leaf spot disease is caused by the fungus Pyricularia grisea, also referred to as Magnaporthe grisea. The frequent warm rainy periods common in Florida create favorable conditions for this fungal disease. This fungus slows grow-in, thins established stands and can kill large areas of St.","Irrigate deeply, but infrequently.
Avoid using post-emergent weed killers on the lawn while the disease is active.
Avoid medium to high nitrogen fertilizer levels.
Improve air circulation and light level on lawn.
Mow at the proper height and only mow when the grass is dry.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Gray_leaf_spot_Cercospora_zeae-maydis_5465607.png/330px-Gray_leaf_spot_Cercospora_zeae-maydis_5465607.png
6,Apple : Black Rot,"Although a few rust pustules can always be found in corn fields throughout the growing season, symptoms generally do not appear until after tasseling. These can be easily recognized and distinguished from other diseases by the development of dark, reddish-brown pustules (uredinia) scattered over both the upper and lower surfaces of the corn leaves. These pustules may appear on any above ground part of the plant, but are most abundant on the leaves. Pustules appear oval to elongate in shape, are generally small, less than 1/4 inch long, and are surrounded by the leaf epidermal layer, where it has broken through. ","To reduce the incidence of corn rust, plant only corn that has resistance to the fungus. Resistance is either in the form of race-specific resistance or partial rust resistance. In either case, no sweet corn is completely resistant. If the corn begins to show symptoms of infection, immediately spray with a fungicide.",https://ohioline.osu.edu/sites/ohioline/files/imce/Plant_Pathology/PLNTPTH-CER-02_Figure_1.png
7,Apple : Cedar rust,"Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) is caused by the fungus Setosphaeria turcica. Symptoms usually appear first on the lower leaves. Leaf lesions are long (1 to 6 inches) and elliptical, gray-green at first but then turn pale gray or tan. Under moist conditions, dark gray spores are produced, usually on the lower leaf surface, which give lesions a ""dirty"" gray appearance. Entire leaves on severely blighted plants can die, so individual lesions are not visible. Lesions may occur on the outer husk of ears, but the kernels are not infected. On hybrids that contain an Ht gene for resistance to the fungus, lesions are smaller, chlorotic, and may develop into linear streaks. These lesions rarely produce spores.","Fungicide applications reduced Northern Corn Leaf Blight damage and protected yield. Fungicide value was higher in reducing yield in susceptible corn hybrids. Fungicide were most effective if they were applied at disease onset. Disease onset varied in growth stages, and so the best stage to apply fungicides.",https://crop-protection-network.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/NLB-Daren-Mueller-02.jpg
8,Apple : Healthy,"Corn plants prefer daytime temperatures of 75 to 80 degrees F and 65 to 70 degrees F during the night. The soil should be kept consistently moist, but not soggy and they only need fertilizer every 6 months. Although dracaena can take low light conditions, they do best when placed in bright but indirect light.It’s just natural for a plant to produce a few yellow leaves, its nothing to get alarmed about.However if it produces a lot of yellow leaves all at once, say five or six, you may be over-watering or the plant may be suffering from a lack of light.","Corn has several health benefits. Because of the high fiber content, it can aid with digestion. It also contains valuable B vitamins, which are important to your overall health. Corn also provides our bodies with essential minerals such as zinc, magnesium, copper, iron and manganese.",https://c8.alamy.com/comp/A85TR2/young-healthy-green-leaves-of-corn-maize-plant-in-pretty-unfolding-A85TR2.jpg
